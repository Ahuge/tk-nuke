display_name: Launch Revolver from the current Nuke session
author: Shotgun Software
description: Adds a menu item which lets you jump from Nuke straight to revolver. The app will 
             search shotgun for versions published for the current shot or asset, and if it finds any, it will 
             start up revolver with the most recent version focused. If no versions are found,
             revolver will be started centered around the current Shot or Asset that is being
             worked on.
